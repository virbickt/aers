To better understand this topic, you need to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzfDLqt-WIg&ab_channel=Socratica) that in TLDR format explains differences between the databases.

        "For the last two days you were learning about relational databases and SQL. You should know that SQL works really well when you have structured data and need to perform multiple data collection manipulations. Parts where SQL lacks are search and optimized document storage. For these specific cases Not Only SQL is used. There are many different types of NoSQL databases. If every SQL database (MySQL, Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL) are familiar, NoSQL world is more diverse and every database has its own specific use cases. Let's talk about most popular ones and where and why they are used. But before that you should watch [more general overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruz-vK8IesE&ab_channel=BeABetterDev) of the NoSQL world."

        "## MongoDB\n",
        "MongoDB is the most used SQL alternative. As Mongo is the most universal and flexible NoSQL database. The biggest advantage of it is scalability. As the data is stored in documents and not in the individual tables, there is no need for joins, which can get quite expensive when working with huge tables full of records. Search is also more optimized in MongoDB. You should take a look into [official documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained) and watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE8ZTQxa0AM&ab_channel=MongoDB) 5 min. video that covers all basic aspects of the database. You can also watch a [comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_kXvOeQ5Y&ab_channel=Academind) made between SQL and NoSQl when talking about MySQL vs MongoDB case."

        "Cassandra is mostly used when working with time series data and key-value storage. Because of unique database structure Cassandra can perform queries instantly and return huge numbers of data in a matter of moment. You should read about Cassandra in [this TLDR](https://www.credera.com/insights/cassandra-explained-5-minutes-less/). You should also watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDhIjrJ7hG0&ab_channel=edureka%21) video that explains Cassandra more in-depth."

        "Redis is mostly used when talking about caching and quick data retrieval. Redis is also widely used in applications where some kind of live counting is needed (for example leaderboards). You should read [blog post](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/redis) created by IBM and learn about most popular use cases and specific data types. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hbt56gFj998&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) is also amazing video that covers most popular Redis use cases and provides practical approach to them."
